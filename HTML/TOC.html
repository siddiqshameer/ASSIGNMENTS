                    <p>A computer is a device that accepts information (in the form of digitalized data) and manipulates it for some result 
                    based on a program or sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed. Complex computers also include the 
                    means for storing data (including the program, which is also a form of data) for some necessary duration. A program may 
                    be invariable and built into the computer (and called logic circuitry as it is on microprocessors) or different programs 
                    may be provided to the computer (loaded into its storage and then started by an administrator or user). Today's computers
                    have both kinds of programming.<br><br><br></p>

                            <p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions 
                            of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations 
                            specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least 
                            since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its
                            processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external
                            components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.<br><br><br><br></p>

                        <dd><p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents 
                            the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful 
                            and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs,      modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU).

                            Most of the operations of a CPU are performed by one or more ALUs, which load data from input registers. 
                            A register is a small amount of storage available as part of a CPU. The control unit tells the ALU what 
                            operation to perform on that data and the ALU stores the result in an output register. The control unit moves 
                            the data between these registers, the ALU, and memory. <br><br><br><br></p>

                        <dd><p>C  is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable 
                            scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that
                            map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly 
                            been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging 
                            from supercomputers to embedded systems.

                            C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs, and used to re-implement the Unix 
                            operating system. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, with C 
                            compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. 
                            C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently 
                            by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).<br><br><br><br></p>

                        <dd><p>C++  is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features,
                             while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

                            It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, 
                            efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, 
                            with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, 
                            servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or 
                            space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various 
                            organizations, including the Free Software Foundation (FSF's GCC), LLVM, Microsoft, Intel and IBM.<br><br><br><br></p>

                            A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model

                            incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects. Most of the object databases also offer some kind of query language, 
                            permitting objects to be found through a declarative programming approach.
                            Also called an object database management system (ODMS)<br><br><br><br></p>

                        <dd><p>A DBMS is said to be hierarchical DBMS, when the data is organized like a tree structure. That means, it simply 
                            represents the data using parent â€“ child relationship. It is the oldest style of organizing/storing data and still 
                            some organizations are using this.
                            It follows one to many relationship. i.e. All parents can have more than one child, but each child should have only one parent.
